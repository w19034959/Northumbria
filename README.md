The system is a web based management tool designed to help a local restaurant/bar with their rota creation and management.
The system starts at the landing page asking the user to log into their account, this account will either have staff or manager permissions and direct the user to the correct page.

A manager can then create or alter a rota, view and respond to rota requests and finally access an admin form to add new staff members.
Staff can view their rota and submit rota requests via their homepage.

While various members are within the system a simple manager and staff log in have been created.
To access the manager section of the system enter manager in both the username and password fields and select manager from the role dropdown.
Entering staff in both the email and password fields and selecting staff in the dropdown will provide access to the staff section.
